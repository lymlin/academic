abstract: 'Backgrounds:	The	increasing	global	burden	of	stroke	requires	a	more comprehensive approach for disease prevention; whether the modifiable vitamin D has protective effects on ischemic stroke or subtypes remains a question. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an emerging independent risk factor on cardiovascular diseases, but its association with ischemic stroke are not consistent. Besides, the causalities between FGF23 and ischemic stroke or subtypes are unclear. Considering the crucial role of FGF23 on vitamin D levels through inhibiting activation and promoting degradation, the function of FGF23 was thought partly dependent on its effects on vitamin D. Thus, vitamin D supplements may benefit for specific groups. Objective: We applied the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to infer the causalities of circulating vitamin D (25OHD, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels and FGF23 levels on ischemic stroke and subtypes, to investigate potential effects of vitamin D supplement among different groups.
Methods: The circulating 25OHD genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (N=417,580，the white British group) from the UK BioBank, 5 SNPs from a seven cohort GWAS meta-study associated with serum FGF23 levels, and the summary statistics of acute ischemic stroke (34,217 cases, 406,111 controls) and subtypes in MEGASTROKE study (European ancestry) were chosen to construct instrumental variants. We filtered genetic variants by association (P < 5.0E-08), linkage disequilibrium (LD r2 < 0.1), possible pleiotropic associations and instrument strength. The inverse-variance weighted method (MR-IVW) was picked to investigate the causal relationship of 25OHD and FGF23 levels on ischemic stroke or subtypes. The weighted-median method (MR-WME), Cochran’Q, and the leave-one-out analysis were employed to evaluate the robustness of causal estimates. Moreover, the Egger intercept test and the PRESSO (Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) test were utilized on sensitive analysis for potential horizontal pleiotropies; and the MR-Steiger method was utilized to evaluate the vertical direction of the causal estimate. Furthermore, we calculate the power of the causal estimate.
Results: We did not find causal relationships of 25OHD with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or subtypes. This study used 60 filtered instrument variables to estimate (MR-IVW) an OR (Odds Ratio) of 1.02 for acute ischemic stroke with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of 0.94-1.12, and 0.94 OR (95% CI 0.76-1.16) for large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS) per SD (standard deviation) increased 25OHD. Three instruments passed the filtering. There were no causal relationships of FGF23 on acute ischemic stroke (MR-IVW; 0.90 OR, 95%CI 0.74-1.09; P = 0.271). We found a suggestive genetic causal association of FGF23 on LAS (MR-IVW; 1.74 OR, 95% CI 1.08-2.81), and the MR-WME result was 1.76 OR (95% CI 1.04-2.99).
There was no Cochran heterogeneity (Q = 0.02, P = 0.993); leave-one-out analysis showed that the effects of each genetic variables on causal estimate were perturbations (-0.13% to 5.8%), and the validated variant near the CYP24A1 gene drove the causal association of FGF23 and LAS. No horizontal pleiotropy was found (MR-Egger intercept -0.001, P = 0.145), and the causal direction was FGF23 to LAS with no conflict (MR-Steiger, P = 3.20 × 10 -14). Three genetic instruments accounted for 0.53% circulating FGF23 levels, and the causal estimate power of FGF23 on LAS was 94%.
Conclusion: Our study did not find a genetic predisposition of a higher circulating 25OHD associated with a lower risk of acute ischemic stroke or subtypes; thus, we neither support nor reject vitamin D supplementation in the general population. We found a genetic predisposition of increased FGF23 associated with a higher risk of large arterial atherosclerotic stroke. Our results suggested a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplements in people with a high risk of LAS (like intracranial atherosclerosis). Further studies should investigate the associated mechanisms of FGF23 in LAS, and the roles of vitamin D and αKlotho in the association of FGF23 and LAS.'
