abstract: 'Despite considerable unmet medical needs, effective pharmacological treatments that promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury remain limited. Although multiple pathological events are implicated in spinal cord injuries, the development of a microinvasive pharmacological approach that simultaneously targets the different mechanisms involved in spinal cord injury remains a formidable challenge. Here we report the development of a microinvasive nanodrug delivery system that consists of amphiphilic copolymers responsive to reactive oxygen species and an encapsulated neurotransmitter-conjugated KCC2 agonist. Upon intravenous administration, the nanodrugs enter the injured spinal cord due to a disruption in the blood–spinal cord barrier and disassembly due to damage-triggered reactive oxygen species. The nanodrugs exhibit dual functions in the injured spinal cord: scavenging accumulated reactive oxygen species in the lesion, thereby protecting spared tissues, and facilitating the integration of spared circuits into the host spinal cord through targeted modulation of inhibitory neurons. This microinvasive treatment leads to notable functional recovery in rats with contusive spinal cord injury.'
