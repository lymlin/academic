abstract: "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a detrimental neurological disease with limited treatments options. It has been challenging to define the roles of brain cell subsets in IS onset and progression due to cellular heterogeneity in the CNS. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell populations in the mouse model of MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion). We identified 17 principal brain clusters with cell-type specific gene expression patterns as well as specific cell subpopulations and their functions in various pathways. The CNS inflammation triggered upregulation of key cell type-specific genes unpublished before. Notably, microglia displayed a cell differentiation diversity after stroke among its five distinct subtypes. Importantly, we found the potential trajectory branches of the monocytes/macrophage's subsets. Finally, we also identified distinct subclusters among brain vasculature cells, ependymal cells and other glia cells. Overall, scRNA-seq revealed the precise transcriptional changes during neuroinflammation at the single-cell level, opening up a new field for exploration of the disease mechanisms and drug discovery in stroke based on the cell-subtype specific molecules."
